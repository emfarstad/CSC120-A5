- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I really liked this assignment. The instructions were very straightforward and the powerpoint from this week really helped me to understand how to initialize and create different variables. 

My initial impression of Association is that I feel like I don't fully know how it applies to my code because in this instance I am not drawing out visually all of the associations, but I am starting to understand the way that methods shared between classes change association and the way that the word "Final" makes things have a composite relationship.
